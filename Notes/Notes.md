## Starting notes

# Learning the VoxelMorph workflow

- Uses keras and tensorflow
- start with a test example that uses 2D MNIST images
- tensorflow 2.16+ contains a bug, link for bugfix: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases
- this solves issue when running :)

- using wget with jupyter https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57748687/downloading-files-in-jupyter-wget-on-windows

- After some version control all is well
    - Currently uses tensorflow v2.15
    - Some of the original example code is deprecated --> Changed some of it to be current

- Successfully ran pretrained model

# TO DO
- Docker implementation
- Build my own model
- Get training data
(my to-dos always suck this will probably get deleted soon)
